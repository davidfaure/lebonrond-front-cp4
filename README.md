### `lebonrond`

A simple classified ad app that allows you to create an account to post offers, update them and delete them. 
You also can browse offer on the app from others and like them.
By creating an account you will have access to your private dashboard to manage your informations, offers and settings.

I made this projet to train my dev skills for the wild code school.

### `Live Demo`
